      <description>Version Review Today I have been reviewing version 2 of my script. The climbing issue of having to create and keep track of the events while preparing for the week is quite frustrating at the least. My Version 3 is to focus on efficiency and also portability.
Currently, I have created a template sheet that generates calendar events based on the tags.
Two issues I have currently related to these events are the following: At the end of the month of the year, How do I change this?</description>

      <description>I have been testing the app scripting since updating the entry. However, I am going as I have been testing, I have been wanting to change the build since the design is more minimalist and also does not clutter the page.
Currently, the design looks like this.
However, I realized that react is very difficult to implement globally. So Alternatively I will remain using the spreadsheet as the base of my tool.</description>

      <description>Since Coming Back to Arch OS. I have been much more technical. Also, I feel freer because I can modify the system without restrictions. However, with these changes, there will never be without cons. At this stage, the only con I have found is package management. I can not keep track of what is installed on my computer.
In terms of upskilling, I have started updating the following repository.

Upskilling Log What have I learned:
Data structures Arrays Dates Google scripting Git commit Technical Documentation Should be keeping up with the time frame Git hub License What I could have worked on:
Git fork API Version Control Version 1 - code.gs
only able to make events Problem:
This is not useable on a daily use. Version 2 - Codev2.gs
Spreadsheet to make all the events Creating a tag for the event STRUCTURE = [TAG] Event , startdate, enddate, description, code This can work in a span of a timeframe creating with one line of code.</description>

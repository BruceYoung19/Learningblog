      <description>Today I Managed to make the drivers work with python. It seems that the examples not trust worthy.
I have followed the link - https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/
My first script allows me to get the header of the page. The next step is to allow me to find the headers. The most helpful thing, I have found in nix os is that I can build a work environment and also keep my personal stuff where they are will all the change to one thing.</description>

      <description>I have been trying to figure how to upskill. As I have just changed back to nixos. The most useful part about nixos is the package management.
I have set up been testing how to set up enviroments in nix. The first environment I have set up today is using nodejs environment. I have taken advantage of the nix-shell command.
Lastly I need to understand, what I should be achieving with this environment.</description>

      <description>Rust - Cargo I have started learning the basic logic of rust in the main.rs, understanding how to use int values and declaring Array. However, this was not realistic for a real project. Since this is the case. I have started to use cargo.
Commit - 1b5cd3f (This will have been updated on the day, which is on the 25/08)
Right now, I have tried to start using the clap framework.</description>

      <description>Today I have been learning how to exact information from the active directory as it is very hard to understand the structure in Powershell is to be used.
for example:
get-aduser However when dealing with loops. It is very hard to adjust to foreach instead of using a for loop.
$emails= \\ list of emails foreach ($user in $emails){ Get-ADUser -Filter{UserPrincipalName -eq $user} -Properties * | Select // what the user is looking for } The commands I have also learned</description>

      <description>After working in the command line for almost 2 years constantly. I have found it much easier to work on infrastructure-based files. However, when building some programs it can be very hard to adjust as I do not have the option to debug like in an open IDE. I am grateful that I have learned this, for the following reasons:
Working with low-powered machines to deploy software or as a workaround for one day.</description>

      <description>Today I have started to learn how to program in Rust. This is very close to how C-base languages work. My first program is Hello World as usual.
However, the ironic thing I have learned a lot about how rust works. Rustc compiles the program Variables - mut, if required change
The second program I have tried is to allow input. I wanted to check if cargo is required for a very basic program.</description>

      <description>PowerShell learning. I have decided to stop learning PowerShell, as in my role in Service Desk. Currently, I have seen the end of life with PowerShell learning, there are no new things I can learn here with the limited amount of time and with the type of work I do.
I will never really see much point in the matter of learning, in terms of career progression, every day I have been using 1 liner and nothing more.</description>

      <description>Learning for Software Testing I have changed it up a bit and started my online course via LinkedIn Learning. I have continued learning in Testing for scripts to gain a better understanding of how scripting can help testers automate graphs and organize data. I have learned the purpose of selenium. In most use cases for the software selenium automates the basic input of a website.
Since the standard changes daily, I have been learning Python simultaneously, as Python is mostly script-based before moving on to JavaScript.</description>

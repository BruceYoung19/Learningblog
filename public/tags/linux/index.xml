      <description>What has been done? The more I have been using Linux the more I understand the issues related to the Pacman and Yay package managers. Always getting the newest packages presents more bugs than I had thought.
I have been reading up on nix os again and will probably be going back to it. Walking away from the language has given me a better perspective on the mistakes I made last time.</description>

      <description>Linux update: Since trying Arch Linux for the last month. I have found it much easier to install packages. This has made me feel less productive as there is a requirement to search and find the requirements for each package.
This is why Nix packages are so useful as there is no requirement to have more than one package management.
Also, I have been trying to find another way to keep track of all of the different projects.</description>

      <title>Hyprland Update - Linux</title>

      <description>Hyprland Testing I finally understand how to create screenshots in Hyprland as no other application would as the compiler is not x11 based. The best way is to use Grim as it takes a picture of the whole screen.
Hyprland configurations are quite easy to learn in the .config/hypr/hyprland.conf. The only confusing thing about how Hyprland wants this to be set up is the idea of using bind = ,Print,exec,grim is hard for me to get around.</description>

      <description>Linux Update: After trying out all of the configurations for dot-files, I have released the pros and cons of real Linux. A Pro, with Linux, is the declaring alias is easy the only requirement is changing the .bashrc file but this is not global like in Nix-OS.
This makes me want to go back to Nix-Os.
As I am using Linux for my daily driver.The window manager concept is tough to get into as it does save battery and also minimizes the use of mouse interactions.</description>

      <title>Nix OS Review</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/2024-06-29/</link>

      <description>Link - https://nixos.org/
I have been using NixOs for four months now, but I think it is time for a change. Currently, at this stage in my career, there is a lot to learn. However, the timeframe for each project has been shortened significantly. Therefore I will be changing to another Linux distribution very shortly.
What I love about the NixOs: Reproducibility, being able to copy over a configuration from git, and rebuilding with one simple command have made my life incredibly easy with maintenance.</description>

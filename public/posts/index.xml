      <description>Modding After testing the paper mod theme, I have realized it is not much different from the normal paper theme. Also, I am still missing a lot of features at this very moment, Like the following: Search Archive Tags Images</description>

      <description>Template searching: From all the choices, I still liked the paper theme. It was just that there were no built-in features. So I upgraded to the Papermod theme.
The Papermod theme comes with useful features, like showing off the links at the front with cool little icons. Also, the theme has some color contrast to reflect color better.</description>

      <description>HUGO - Hosted for the first time. This is my first time hosting a website from Git Hub as this will be an excellent way to keep track of all my work.
Currently, I am trying the normal paper theme. it is great that it is minimalist and provides ways to show the posts. However, there is no design element to the theme.
So therefore, we will be changing over to another theme in Hugo.</description>

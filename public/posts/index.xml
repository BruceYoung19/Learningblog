      <description>Since Coming Back to Arch OS. I have been much more technical. Also, I feel freer because I can modify the system without restrictions. However, with these changes, there will never be without cons. At this stage, the only con I have found is package management. I can not keep track of what is installed on my computer.
In terms of upskilling, I have started updating the following repository.

Upskilling Log What have I learned:
Data structures Arrays Dates Google scripting Git commit Technical Documentation Should be keeping up with the time frame Git hub License What I could have worked on:
Git fork API Version Control Version 1 - code.gs
only able to make events Problem:
This is not useable on a daily use. Version 2 - Codev2.gs
Spreadsheet to make all the events Creating a tag for the event STRUCTURE = [TAG] Event , startdate, enddate, description, code This can work in a span of a timeframe creating with one line of code.</description>

      <title>Nix OS Review</title>

I have been using NixOs for four months now, but I think it is time for a change. Currently, at this stage in my career, there is a lot to learn. However, the timeframe for each project has been shortened significantly. Therefore I will be changing to another Linux distribution very shortly.
What I love about the NixOs: Reproducibility, being able to copy over a configuration from git, and rebuilding with one simple command have made my life incredibly easy with maintenance.</description>

      <description>Modding After testing the paper mod theme, I have realized it is not much different from the normal paper theme. Also, I am still missing a lot of features at this very moment, Like the following:

      <description>HUGO - Hosted for the first time. This is my first time hosting a website from Git Hub as this will be an excellent way to keep track of all my work.
Currently, I am trying the normal paper theme. it is great that it is minimalist and provides ways to show the posts. However, there is no design element to the theme.
So therefore, we will be changing over to another theme in Hugo.</description>

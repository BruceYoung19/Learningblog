Learning for Software Testing
I have changed it up a bit and started my online course via LinkedIn Learning. I have continued learning in Testing for scripts to gain a better understanding of how scripting can help testers automate graphs and organize data.

I have learned the purpose of selenium. In most use cases for the software selenium automates the basic input of a website.

Since the standard changes daily, I have been learning Python simultaneously, as Python is mostly script-based before moving on to JavaScript.

From this course, what I have learned today. Two useful tools that can be used for software testing are:
- Selenium
- Google APIs, Integrated with Google Sheets

I am still reading through the ISTQB. There is quite a bit of reading because it is about 400 pages.

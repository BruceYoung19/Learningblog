## Linux Update:
After trying out all of the configurations for dot-files, I have released the pros and cons of real Linux. A Pro, with Linux, is the declaring alias is easy the only requirement is changing the ```.bashrc``` file but this is not global like in Nix-OS.

This makes me want to go back to Nix-Os. 

As I am using Linux for my daily driver.The window manager concept is tough to get into as it does save battery and also minimizes the use of mouse interactions. However, a very big issue is not being able to take screenshots.

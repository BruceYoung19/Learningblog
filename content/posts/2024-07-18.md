# Hyprland Testing 

I finally understand how to create screenshots in Hyprland as no other application would as the compiler is not x11 based. The best way is to use Grim as it takes a picture of the whole screen.

Hyprland configurations are quite easy to learn in the ```.config/hypr/hyprland.conf```. The only confusing thing about how Hyprland wants this to be set up is the idea of using 
```bind = ,Print,exec,grim ``` is hard for me to get around.  This is hard to get around because I have been scripting a lot and the way that most scripts are generated requires all conditions of the command to be filled out.

Waybar is very hard for me to get into. This is Because the components do not make sense. So I have started to use ags.  Ags using the following as a base to build it:
Javascript - to build the bar 
Css - style the bar

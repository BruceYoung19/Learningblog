# Linux update:

Since trying Arch Linux for the last month. I have found it much easier to install packages. This has made me feel less productive as there is a requirement to search and find the requirements for each package.  

This is why Nix packages are so useful as there is no requirement to have more than one package management. 

Also, I have been trying to find another way to keep track of all of the different projects. Since being on arch, I have found my head is slightly more messy. I may have to use Rust to build this tool or maybe this is another reason to return to nix os.

This makes me want to go back to nix os. However, I have not needed to go back to the environment.

The biggest regard for leaving nix os right now is the cook-book function that is built into the os as this requires very little configuration.

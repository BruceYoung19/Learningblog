# Rust - Cargo

I have started learning the basic logic of rust in the main.rs, understanding how to use int values and declaring Array. However, this was not realistic for a real project. Since this is the case. I have started to use cargo.

Commit - 1b5cd3f (This will have been updated on the day, which is on the 25/08)

Right now, I have tried to start using the clap framework. However, I do not understand how to use it with the class programming at this point. Right now I am making a lot of mistakes.

I have committed to a new branch as I will be moving back onto NixOs.I understand this is not the process of a software developer. However, I do not want to move this locally, which may cause more issues.

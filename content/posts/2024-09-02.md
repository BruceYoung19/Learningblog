I wanted to try something new today. So I tried to build a Chrome extension. This is very basic, the requirement is an HTML file, a CSS file, and a manifest file. After trying this out, I have found this to be very limited as there is not a lot we can do with just HTML and CSS. Perhaps I can expand to javaScript further down the line.

Currently I have learned the following:
- Changing the ICON.
- Created extension

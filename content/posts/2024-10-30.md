Today, I have been using powershell to learn how to develop a website.
By using powershell, I have started using the pode module as the host. 

I have been following:
https://badgerati.github.io/Pode/Getting-Started/FirstApp/#rest-server
To get my servers working.
 

The file format is quite simple. It is much like most web development.
Currently, my understanding of pode is that it relies on:
- Server.ps1 - for the host
- package.json- version control.


Pode is quite fun learning as the only requirement is to develop install the pode module
 

install-module -name pode
Pode has very useful syntax as you can use its syntax to develop.
 

pode init , create the package of the website.
pode run, run the server and test it.
 

However, it seems it is only used for deploying powershell scripts.
Which cannot be used for any benefit for the business.

Today I have been learning how to exact information from the active directory as it is very hard to understand the structure in Powershell is to be used.

for example:
```
get-aduser
```

However when dealing with loops. It is very hard to adjust to foreach instead of using a for loop.

```
$emails= \\ list of emails

foreach ($user in $emails){
Get-ADUser -Filter{UserPrincipalName -eq $user} -Properties * | Select // what the user is looking for
}
```

The commands I have also learned
```
get-aduser # Getting active Directory information
whoami \groups # Getting the groups they are added too.
```

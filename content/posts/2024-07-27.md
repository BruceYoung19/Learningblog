## PowerShell learning.

I have decided to stop learning PowerShell, as in my role in Service Desk.
Currently, I have seen the end of life with PowerShell learning, there are no new things I can learn here with the limited amount of time and with the type of work I do.

I will never really see much point in the matter of learning, in terms of career progression, every day I have been using 1 liner and nothing more.

Also, since I am also using Linux on a day-to-day basis. There is no real need for PowerShell.

## Python
I think I will be focusing on Python since I am on Linux.
Also, this would give me a chance to learn both software testing skills and Python development skills.
My previous development with Python was small little modules. However, this time I will be moving on to much bigger projects since I have now got a better handling of programming.

In my Github, I will be updating the readme file to update this too.

## What has been done?
The more I have been using Linux the more I understand the issues related to the Pacman and Yay package managers. Always getting the newest packages presents more bugs than I had thought.

I have been reading up on nix os again and will probably be going back to it.
Walking away from the language has given me a better perspective on the mistakes I made last time.

The urgent things I have to complete before changing over first are the following :
- Calendar script
- Hyprland testing
- Dot files

## Project update
I have finally fixed the issue with the months. Since my last app script version was counting each date. This time I have utilized JavaScript used its built-in functions. 

Also, I have decided to not use an email function as it is making unnecessary work for me and also it's hard to find all the information. I will be updating my idea after I complete the next few functions.

## Problem
My biggest issue at the moment is to create events during the day. Since I have been testing the HTML side of Appscript. The only way to make this work is to push all the functions to a website, with an extra need to be created as per the list on the website.

The purpose of this function is to allow this to be more portable and also to better access this via a chrome book, should this still be a thing. 

What is next to be done? 
The Excel sheet needs to be read.
Create the calendar events based on the correct tag.

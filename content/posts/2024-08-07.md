# Linux learning

After working in the command line for almost 2 years constantly. I have found it much easier to work on infrastructure-based files. However, when building some programs it can be very hard to adjust as I do not have the option to debug like in an open IDE. I am grateful that I have learned this, for the following
reasons:

1. Working with low-powered machines to deploy software or as a workaround for one day.

2. Learning such tools such as nano or vim. Which are incredible for command-line learning. Right now, I am enjoying Vim for the use case.

3. Remoted machines/ Servers in which case are set up for specific purposes or we have very limited access for storage and access.

4. Not everything requires a GUI, if so what happens if it crashes this is another way to interface with it.

Since Coming Back to Arch OS. I have been much more technical. Also, I feel freer because I can modify the system without restrictions. However, with these changes, there will never be without cons. At this stage, the only con I have found is package management. I can not keep track of what is installed on my computer.

In terms of upskilling, I have started updating the following repository.

## What have I been updating?
I have started updating this repository with new commands I have been testing in the role. 

## Project updates:
Currently, I am still in the testing phase of this project - Calendar Script in Google Appscript. However, I will be fixing more than one of my GitHub repositories together, as all would be required for the version of my project and it will be too hard to maintain these two repositories.

Primary repository:
https://github.com/BruceYoung19/GoogleCalendarScript

Pending Removal:
https://github.com/BruceYoung19/appscriptticketsystem 

## Personal update
Right now, I am not very happy in this role but I am trying to make do with what I have.  Lastly, I have improved my time management skills.

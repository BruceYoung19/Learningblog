# Version Review
Today I have been reviewing version 2 of my script. The climbing issue of having to create and keep track of the events while preparing for the week is quite frustrating at the least.  My Version 3 is to focus on efficiency and also portability.

Currently, I have created a template sheet that generates calendar events based on the tags. 

Two issues I have currently related to these events are the following:
At the end of the month of the year, How do I change this?
Also with the tags concept. How else can I utilize this to create events with this on for everyday events?
How do I create an event based on a day of the week?

# HUGO - Hosted for the first time.
This is my first time hosting a website from Git Hub as this will be an excellent way to keep track of all my work.

Currently, I am trying the normal paper theme.
it is great that it is minimalist and provides ways to show the posts. However, there is no design element to the theme.

So therefore, we will be changing over to another theme in Hugo.

Today I thought I would try something easiest and more creative. What I have done, is create updated my waybar in hyprland.

However, it was this did not meet my functional requirements. So what I have done is changed the idea.  Since coming to hyprland I do not really take advantage of the workspace feature, I have left this on the left hand side. 

The biggest issue, I had setting this up was related to the fonts that had been set up on this machine. At first, I did not understand why the symbols were not working, I would get a box instead of the symbol I wanted. Originally I though it was that a unicode issue. However, as per tables, there is no system based symbols.

I then tried to install awesome fonts and rebooted. All worked.

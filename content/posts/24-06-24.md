## Template searching:
From all the choices, I still liked the paper theme. It was just that there were no built-in features. So I upgraded to the Papermod theme.

The Papermod theme comes with useful features, like showing off the links at the front with cool little icons. Also, the theme has some color contrast to reflect color better.

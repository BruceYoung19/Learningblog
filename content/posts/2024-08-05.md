Today I have started to learn how to program in Rust. This is very close to how C-base languages work. My first program is Hello World as usual.

However, the ironic thing I have learned a lot about how rust works.
Rustc compiles the program
Variables - mut, if required change

The second program I have tried is to allow input. I wanted to check if cargo is required for a very basic program. The answer is no.

What is next?
- Cargo
- Library testing
- Yew
- Clap

At this point of the fence. I am not sure if should learn this as I understand it is good to have an understanding. However, would this be able to land me a job?

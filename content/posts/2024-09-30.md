Today , I have tried to set up a server on my raspberry pi. I have been wanting to try setting up a some servers for year now. However have been trying too afraid of experiment in the past.  So today I tried to set a media server.
Issues:  
Media on the USB - After using docker-compose , i was not see my media.  
Fix :
After mounting the device. Docker is having a hard time, seeing media. I changed my docker-compose.yml file to see the mounted location. Solution solved.

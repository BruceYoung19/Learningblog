I have been testing the app scripting since updating the entry. However, I am going as I have been testing, I have been wanting to change the build since the design is more minimalist and also does not clutter the page.

Currently, the design looks like this.

However, I realized that react is very difficult to implement globally. So Alternatively I will remain using the spreadsheet as the base of my tool.  

Firstly I have tried to make my code more efficient because there is still a big bug in my version 2.  Also, my previous code was 299 lines long which includes the comments. I am hoping to bring it down a bit for readability's sake.

In my draft version, I have managed to break methods to be smaller and more efficient as one line of code will have data required, and further more no loops are required yet.

Also, I have tried to make it more convenient for the user so the schedule of the week can be applied instead of manually applying it.  

The benefit here is that extra features can be loaded without increasing the number of lines of code.

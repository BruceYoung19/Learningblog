Today I have decided to change the appscript spreadsheet requirements as I have found that I am always having to copy and paste stuff into my template. So I have added a requirement for an on and off switch in the excelsheet and the appscript. 

This also allows people to set up a roaster type timetable for university or work. 

In this case I have updated the git file. However I will need to update the .git file.

What is also required to update the user guide.
